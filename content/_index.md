# Welcome!
This website presents the **Encyclopedia of Polarization** and the accompanying R package ```polaR```.

## üìò Encyclopedia of Polarization

The *Encyclopedia of Polarization* is an online repository that catalogs available measures of political polarization and their use in applied research, as well as data sources for cross-national comparative research. It currently describes ten measures of political polarization used in comparative research.

The *Encyclopedia* helps researchers navigate the field by categorizing extant approaches by types of [Polarization]({{< ref "polarisation" >}}), [Measures]({{< ref "Measures" >}}) used, [Levels]({{< ref "Levels" >}}) of analysis, [Data]({{< ref "Data" >}}) used, and by providing a comprehensive list of [use cases]({{< ref "usecases" >}}).

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è polaR

```polaR``` is an R package that we are currently developing, which implements the measures documented in the *Encyclopedia* and provides functions for importing the most commonly used cross-national comparative datasets. The package currently supports four of the datasets and six out of the ten measures of polarization documented in the Encyclopedia. The development version of the package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/felixgruenewald/polref) and comments and feedback are very welcome. 

## üë• The team

The *Encyclopedia of Polarization* is developed by the Emmy Noether research group "Polarization through and in referendums: mapping polarization within and beyond the party system" led by [Arndt Leininger](https://aleininger.eu/). [Felix Gr√ºnewald](https://felixgruenewald.net/) leads the development of the *Encyclopedia* and ```polaR```. We are supported by our excellent research assistant [Marcel Schneider](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/phil/politik/pf/professur/Schneider.php.en). We are based at [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://tu-chemnitz.de/polmeth).

We also work on a literature review on polarization in multiparty systems, which you can find on [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mz6rs/):
