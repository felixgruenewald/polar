## Description
[Dalton (2008)]({{< ref "dalton_quantity_2008" >}}) proposes the Polarization Index, which measures ideological polarization among parties based on CSES respondents' placement of parties on a left-right scale. It is the most widely used measure of ideological polarization and can also be used to measure ideological polarization at the mass level (see [Reiljan (2020)]({{< ref "reiljan_fear_2020" >}})).

## Operationalization
The Polarization Index can be calculated as follows. First, the party positions are calculated as an average of the left-right scores assigned to parties by respondents, and then the polarization index is calculated using the following formula:

$$PI_k = \sqrt{V_{jk} (\frac{P_{jk}-\bar{P_k}}{5})^2 }$$
where $P_{jk}$ is the left-right position of party $j$ in a country-year sample $k$ and $\bar{P_k}$ is the average position of all parties considered. $V_{jk}$ is the vote share of party $P_{jk}$.
