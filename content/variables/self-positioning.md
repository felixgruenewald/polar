## Variable description

This item asks respondents about their own position on an issue. This can be used to measure the spread of opinions among the electorate (see measure [Standard Deviation]({{< ref "sd" >}})), or to put respondents into relation to the party system and their perception of [party positions]({{< ref "party-position" >}}). 

Self placement items are very broadly available in a wide range of survey datasets. Most commonly, they query respondents' left-right position, but other issue dimensions are also possible.
